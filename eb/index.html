				<b>Bio</b>: Quiet student by day, sleep-deprived obsessive coder by night. I live a rather unpredictable life. Every day is a new adventure. I find joy in tackling complex problems, finding new and creative ways to overcome difficulties, pushing the boundaries of what can be done. Currently I am an impoverished college student at UPLB.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Expectations for the subject and professor</b> - I expect to learn more on web programming, and I am particularly interested on client-server interaction and learning how to code web applications. I expect the professor to be a skilled and competent instructor, ready to clarify any inquiries a student may have, and push us to excel.<br>
